 Hi, Naval. Tumblr doesn’t allow the creation of a custom RSS feed address. You might try burning your Tumblr feed in FeedBurner, using FeedBurner’s MyBrand feature to associate the burned feed with your custom domain, and then editing the Custom HTML of your Tumblr theme to point browsers/RSS readers to the RSS feed from FeedBurner MyBrand rather than to Tumblr’s default RSS feed.
I know MyBrand will let you keep http://www.naval.mystagingwebsite.com in your feed address. I’m not sure if it will let you keep /journal/rss.xml. You’d have to experiment or ask the FeedBurner folks.
Info from FeedBurner:
http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/mybrand
Sorry that I can’t be of more help on this issue. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can help you with. Thanks for using Tumblr!

 Hi, Naval. Tumblr doesn’t allow the creation of a custom RSS feed address. You might try burning your Tumblr feed in FeedBurner, using FeedBurner’s MyBrand feature to associate the burned feed with your custom domain, and then editing the Custom HTML of your Tumblr theme to point browsers/RSS readers to the RSS feed from FeedBurner MyBrand rather than to Tumblr’s default RSS feed.
I know MyBrand will let you keep http://www.naval.mystagingwebsite.com in your feed address. I’m not sure if it will let you keep /journal/rss.xml. You’d have to experiment or ask the FeedBurner folks.
Info from FeedBurner:
http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/mybrand
Sorry that I can’t be of more help on this issue. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can help you with. Thanks for using Tumblr!
