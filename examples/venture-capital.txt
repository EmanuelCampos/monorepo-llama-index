Everybody Thinks They Already Have Good Judgment



It takes years to know if you have good judgment



For the past few episodes, we talked about why you should angel invest and how to get proprietary dealflow by building a brand.

			There is an opportunity for a new VC Firm to brand itself. Recent brands in Venture Capital arose from transparency and founder-friendliness. YCombinator gives new, young, technical talent an entry into Silicon Valley. 500 Startups does it globally. Fred Wilson blogs the business. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz back Founders to be Public Company CEOs. More

				There is No Angel Bubble. There are Many Angel Bubbles.
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			A common meme floating around right now is that there is an Angel investing bubble.
In the sense that an enormous amount of capital is being placed at risk, and its popping will have grave macro-economic consequences, No.
The total amount of additional capital flowing through the Silicon Valley early-stage ecosystem, thanks to Super-Angels and newly minted millionaires, is on the order of half-a-billion dollars or so. More

				The Unbundling of the Venture Capital Industry
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			People often mock Super-Angels as being impure because they invest other people’s money. We also often get asked “What are VCs and Seed Funds doing on AngelList?” (They’re clearly marked, by the way, and you can choose who your pitch is visible to.)
I will propose, however, that whose money you’re investing is less relevant than on what terms it comes on. More

				Funding Markets Develop in Reverse
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			I co-founded AngelList because I was tired of saying no to entrepreneurs. I wanted to say instead, “yes, we can help you get funded.”
So, it’s especially disappointing when we get promising startups pitching on AngelList from remote locations. Some we’ve managed to get funded – including ones in Canada and Europe. More

				Why (Private) Investors are Herd Animals
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			It’s a common complaint – venture investors are driven by what other investors think, and therefore lack imagination and spine.
There’s some truth to it – it is human nature, after all, to look for social proof and authority when making decisions. However, that’s not the whole story.
In public markets, Investors make their decisions to invest in parallel, and in theory, most of the relevant information about a company is publicly disclosed, by law. More

				Who has time for meetings?
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			A lot of entrepreneurs assume that the initial way to engage with an investor is to *insist* on a meeting. It’s a relatively safe assumption that anyone on the buy side (an investor, an advertiser, an executive at a large company) receives far more requests for meetings than they can follow up on, and are constantly looking for excuses to say “no.”
Synchronous activities, such as phone calls, screencasts, videos, and webex conferences are almost as bad. More

In public markets, Investors make their decisions to invest in parallel, and in theory, most of the relevant information about a company is publicly disclosed, by law. More

Everybody Thinks They Already Have Good Judgment



It takes years to know if you have good judgment



For the past few episodes, we talked about why you should angel invest and how to get proprietary dealflow by building a brand.

In the sense that an enormous amount of capital is being placed at risk, and its popping will have grave macro-economic consequences, No.

Everybody Thinks They Already Have Good Judgment



It takes years to know if you have good judgment



For the past few episodes, we talked about why you should angel invest and how to get proprietary dealflow by building a brand.

Hey everybody, it’s Naval and Nivi. We’re going to talk about something very different than what we’ve discussed in the past.



Back in the day, we did Venture Hacks, which was all about the game theory of venture capital and helping entrepreneurs raise money.

			A common meme floating around right now is that there is an Angel investing bubble.
In the sense that an enormous amount of capital is being placed at risk, and its popping will have grave macro-economic consequences, No.
The total amount of additional capital flowing through the Silicon Valley early-stage ecosystem, thanks to Super-Angels and newly minted millionaires, is on the order of half-a-billion dollars or so. More

				The Unbundling of the Venture Capital Industry
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			People often mock Super-Angels as being impure because they invest other people’s money. We also often get asked “What are VCs and Seed Funds doing on AngelList?” (They’re clearly marked, by the way, and you can choose who your pitch is visible to.)
I will propose, however, that whose money you’re investing is less relevant than on what terms it comes on. More

			I co-founded AngelList because I was tired of saying no to entrepreneurs. I wanted to say instead, “yes, we can help you get funded.”
So, it’s especially disappointing when we get promising startups pitching on AngelList from remote locations. Some we’ve managed to get funded – including ones in Canada and Europe. More

				Why (Private) Investors are Herd Animals
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			It’s a common complaint – venture investors are driven by what other investors think, and therefore lack imagination and spine.
There’s some truth to it – it is human nature, after all, to look for social proof and authority when making decisions. However, that’s not the whole story.
In public markets, Investors make their decisions to invest in parallel, and in theory, most of the relevant information about a company is publicly disclosed, by law. More

				Who has time for meetings?
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			A lot of entrepreneurs assume that the initial way to engage with an investor is to *insist* on a meeting. It’s a relatively safe assumption that anyone on the buy side (an investor, an advertiser, an executive at a large company) receives far more requests for meetings than they can follow up on, and are constantly looking for excuses to say “no.”
Synchronous activities, such as phone calls, screencasts, videos, and webex conferences are almost as bad. More

				Funding Markets Develop in Reverse
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			I co-founded AngelList because I was tired of saying no to entrepreneurs. I wanted to say instead, “yes, we can help you get funded.”
So, it’s especially disappointing when we get promising startups pitching on AngelList from remote locations. Some we’ve managed to get funded – including ones in Canada and Europe. More

				Why (Private) Investors are Herd Animals
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			It’s a common complaint – venture investors are driven by what other investors think, and therefore lack imagination and spine.
There’s some truth to it – it is human nature, after all, to look for social proof and authority when making decisions. However, that’s not the whole story.
In public markets, Investors make their decisions to invest in parallel, and in theory, most of the relevant information about a company is publicly disclosed, by law. More

			A lot of entrepreneurs assume that the initial way to engage with an investor is to *insist* on a meeting. It’s a relatively safe assumption that anyone on the buy side (an investor, an advertiser, an executive at a large company) receives far more requests for meetings than they can follow up on, and are constantly looking for excuses to say “no.”
Synchronous activities, such as phone calls, screencasts, videos, and webex conferences are almost as bad. More

In the sense that an enormous amount of capital is being placed at risk, and its popping will have grave macro-economic consequences, No.
The total amount of additional capital flowing through the Silicon Valley early-stage ecosystem, thanks to Super-Angels and newly minted millionaires, is on the order of half-a-billion dollars or so. More
