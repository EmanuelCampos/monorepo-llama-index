				Externalities: Calculating the Hidden Costs of Products
			 	
			  
				Externalities let you account for the true cost of products by including hidden costs
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			What’s a mispriced externality? You mentioned it on a previous episode.



 An externality is where there’s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that’s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.

				Net Present Value: What Future Income Is Worth Today
			 	
			  
				See what future income is worth today by applying a discount to its future value
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Let’s talk about net present value (NPV).



 Net present value is when you say, “That stream of payments I’m going to get in the future—what’s it worth today?”



Here’s a common example: You’re joining a startup and getting stock options, and the founder says, “This company is going to be worth $1 billion, and I’m giving you 0.1% of the company; therefore, you’re getting $1 million worth of stock.” More

				Consumer Surplus: Getting More Than You Paid For
			 	
			  
				People are willing to pay more than what companies charge
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.



I get a lot of joy out of my morning Starbucks coffee. Obviously I’ve made some money. So if my coffee cost $20, I would pay it.

			Are there any other microeconomic concepts, outside of zero marginal cost of replication and scale economies, that are important to understand?



 Price discrimination is important. It means you can charge people based on their propensity to pay.



Now, you can’t charge people different amounts just because you don’t like them.

				Compounding Relationships Make Life Easier
			 	
			  
				Life gets a lot easier when you know someone’s got your back
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Earlier, we talked about compound interest, but we didn’t dig into it much.



 Relationships offer a good example of compound interest. Once you’ve been in a good relationship with somebody for a while—whether it’s business or romantic—life gets a lot easier because you know that person’s got your back.

 Pareto optimal is another concept from game theory, along with Pareto superior.



Pareto superior means something is better in some ways while being equal or better in other ways. It’s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you’re negotiating.

The Schelling point is a game theory concept made famous by Thomas Schelling in his book, The Strategy of Conflict, which I recommend.



It’s about multiplayer games where people respond based on what they think the other person’s response will be.

				Kelly Criterion: Avoid Ruin
			 	
			  
				Don't ruin your reputation or get wiped to zero
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Let’s chat about the Kelly criterion. 



 The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don’t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don’t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don’t lose the whole kitty. 



If you’re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge—because even when you have an edge, you can still lose.

			What’s a mispriced externality? You mentioned it on a previous episode.



 An externality is where there’s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that’s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.

			Let’s talk about net present value (NPV).



 Net present value is when you say, “That stream of payments I’m going to get in the future—what’s it worth today?”



Here’s a common example: You’re joining a startup and getting stock options, and the founder says, “This company is going to be worth $1 billion, and I’m giving you 0.1% of the company; therefore, you’re getting $1 million worth of stock.” More

				Consumer Surplus: Getting More Than You Paid For

			Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.



I get a lot of joy out of my morning Starbucks coffee. Obviously I’ve made some money. So if my coffee cost $20, I would pay it.

 Price discrimination is important. It means you can charge people based on their propensity to pay.



Now, you can’t charge people different amounts just because you don’t like them.

			Earlier, we talked about compound interest, but we didn’t dig into it much.



 Relationships offer a good example of compound interest. Once you’ve been in a good relationship with somebody for a while—whether it’s business or romantic—life gets a lot easier because you know that person’s got your back.

 Pareto optimal is another concept from game theory, along with Pareto superior.



Pareto superior means something is better in some ways while being equal or better in other ways. It’s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you’re negotiating.

			Let’s chat about the Kelly criterion. 



 The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don’t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don’t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don’t lose the whole kitty. 



If you’re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge—because even when you have an edge, you can still lose.

			Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.



I get a lot of joy out of my morning Starbucks coffee. Obviously I’ve made some money. So if my coffee cost $20, I would pay it.

			Earlier, we talked about compound interest, but we didn’t dig into it much.



 Relationships offer a good example of compound interest. Once you’ve been in a good relationship with somebody for a while—whether it’s business or romantic—life gets a lot easier because you know that person’s got your back.

 Pareto optimal is another concept from game theory, along with Pareto superior.



Pareto superior means something is better in some ways while being equal or better in other ways. It’s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you’re negotiating.

			Let’s chat about the Kelly criterion. 



 The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don’t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don’t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don’t lose the whole kitty. 



If you’re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge—because even when you have an edge, you can still lose.

 An externality is where there’s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that’s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.

 An externality is where there’s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that’s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.

Here’s a common example: You’re joining a startup and getting stock options, and the founder says, “This company is going to be worth $1 billion, and I’m giving you 0.1% of the company; therefore, you’re getting $1 million worth of stock.” More

			What’s a mispriced externality? You mentioned it on a previous episode.



 An externality is where there’s an additional cost imposed by whatever product is being produced or consumed, that’s not accounted for in the price of the product. This can happen for many reasons. Sometimes you can fix it by putting the cost back into the price.

			Let’s talk about net present value (NPV).



 Net present value is when you say, “That stream of payments I’m going to get in the future—what’s it worth today?”



Here’s a common example: You’re joining a startup and getting stock options, and the founder says, “This company is going to be worth $1 billion, and I’m giving you 0.1% of the company; therefore, you’re getting $1 million worth of stock.” More

			Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.



I get a lot of joy out of my morning Starbucks coffee. Obviously I’ve made some money. So if my coffee cost $20, I would pay it.

				You can charge people for extras based on their propensity to pay
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Are there any other microeconomic concepts, outside of zero marginal cost of replication and scale economies, that are important to understand?



 Price discrimination is important. It means you can charge people based on their propensity to pay.



Now, you can’t charge people different amounts just because you don’t like them.

				Compounding Relationships Make Life Easier
			 	
			  
				Life gets a lot easier when you know someone’s got your back
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Earlier, we talked about compound interest, but we didn’t dig into it much.



 Relationships offer a good example of compound interest. Once you’ve been in a good relationship with somebody for a while—whether it’s business or romantic—life gets a lot easier because you know that person’s got your back.

			Do you want to talk about Pareto optimal?



 Pareto optimal is another concept from game theory, along with Pareto superior.



Pareto superior means something is better in some ways while being equal or better in other ways. It’s not worse in any way. This is an important concept when you’re negotiating.

The Schelling point is a game theory concept made famous by Thomas Schelling in his book, The Strategy of Conflict, which I recommend.



It’s about multiplayer games where people respond based on what they think the other person’s response will be.

				Kelly Criterion: Avoid Ruin
			 	
			  
				Don't ruin your reputation or get wiped to zero
			  						
			
			
			
		
		

			Let’s chat about the Kelly criterion. 



 The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don’t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don’t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don’t lose the whole kitty. 



If you’re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge—because even when you have an edge, you can still lose.

Consumer Surplus: Getting More Than You Paid For
Consumer Surplus: Getting More Than You Paid For
People are willing to pay more than what companies charge
Consumer surplus and producer surplus are important concepts. Consumer surplus is the excess value you get from something when you pay less than you were willing to pay.

 The Kelly criterion is a popularized mathematical formulation of a simple concept. The simple concept is: Don’t risk everything. Stay out of jail. Don’t bet everything on one big gamble. Be careful how much you bet each time, so you don’t lose the whole kitty. 



If you’re a gambler, the Kelly criterion mathematically formulates how much you should wager per hand, even if you have an edge—because even when you have an edge, you can still lose.
