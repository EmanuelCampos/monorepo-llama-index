			Barry Diller wants Ask.com to grow market share. I’m sure there’s lots to be done on improving distribution deals, the crawler, back-end algorithms, etc., but how about starting with some simple, obvious UI fixes? Here are the results of a search for “Search Engine” on the 4 majors:
<img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/nav.al/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jeeves-001.jpg?resize=384%2C288" alt="jeeves.001.jpg" border="0" width="384" height="288" data-recalc-dims="1"  />
<img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/nav.al/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jeeves-002.jpg?resize=384%2C288" alt="jeeves.002.jpg" border="0" width="384" height="288" data-recalc-dims="1"  />

<img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/nav.al/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jeeves-004.jpg?resize=384%2C288" alt="jeeves.004.jpg" border="0" width="384" height="288" data-recalc-dims="1"  />
At 1024×768, the UI differences are glaring. I’ve marked the ads in red and the information of dubious value in blue. The green checks indicate relevant, high-quality results. 
To the average surfer, the info in white is all that matters. Note to everyone else except Google – fix the UI first – it’s the low-hanging fruit.
