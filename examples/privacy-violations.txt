			All sorts of businesses are being built by violating assumptions about the privacy of data.
Flickr violated the assumption that you wanted your photos private by default. Before Flickr came along, the default photo sharing model, espoused by Shutterfly, Snapfish etc., was that of private photo sharing.
LinkedIn violates the assumption that your resumé is private.
FourSquare violates the assumption that your location is private.
Twitter violates the assumption that some of your thoughts are private.
Instagr.am violates the assumption that your mobile photos are private.
Blippy is testing the assumption that some of your financial transactions are private.
All of these services take your original notion and need for privacy, and trade them off against your need for fame and recognition.
