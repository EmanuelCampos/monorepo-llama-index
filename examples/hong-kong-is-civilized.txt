			Free wifi in the airport, need I say more? Ok, what is stifling about airports and modern travel is the lack of control. Stand in line. Wait. Sit on the plane. Fasten your seatbelt. Put away your tray table. Close the windowshade. What is web-surfing? Here’s a blank location bar – now go, wherever you will. As in the Matrix, when your body is confined, the mind wishes to roam. Many a government could ease the suffering of its citizens by offering them mental freedom when it imposes physical confinement. The web is powerful and American in its origins in that it exports the one classic American virtue – freedom.
