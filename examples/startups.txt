				Build a Team that Ships
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			I started my first company 15 years go, and I still can’t manage. I suspect that very few people can. With AngelList, we want a team of self-managing people who ship code.
Here’s what we do:

Keep the team small. All doers, no talkers. Absolutely no middle managers. All BD via APIs. More

The cost of starting a company has collapsed. It’s now just (minimal) salaries. For entrepreneurs, desks are free, hosting is free, marketing is online, and company setup is cheap.
Raising the first $25K for product development is easy – join an incubator. More

			Y Combinator* is the new Graduate School.
In some ways, it’s better:
– You pay to go to graduate school. YC pays you.
– After school, you get a job. After YC, you create jobs.
– You repeat the works of the greats in school. YC expects you to do original work. More

I only know of four viable methods:

A simple core built-in feature, where by using the product, users invite / share it with others. This used to be mostly about email address import, although these days Digging, Tweeting, and of course, spreading on Facebook are very popular
Users embed the product onto their own blogs / pages / sites
Users create original content that gets picked up by GoogleBot, gets SEO’ed, and then brings in other users via Google search. More

				Build a Team that Ships
			 	
			 						
			
			
			
		
		

			I started my first company 15 years go, and I still can’t manage. I suspect that very few people can. With AngelList, we want a team of self-managing people who ship code.
Here’s what we do:

Keep the team small. All doers, no talkers. Absolutely no middle managers. All BD via APIs. More

			There isn’t a shortage of developers and designers. There’s a surplus of founders.
The cost of starting a company has collapsed. It’s now just (minimal) salaries. For entrepreneurs, desks are free, hosting is free, marketing is online, and company setup is cheap.
Raising the first $25K for product development is easy – join an incubator. More

			Y Combinator* is the new Graduate School.
In some ways, it’s better:
– You pay to go to graduate school. YC pays you.
– After school, you get a job. After YC, you create jobs.
– You repeat the works of the greats in school. YC expects you to do original work. More

I found myself telling an entrepreneur why he had to be in Silicon Valley if he wanted to succeed. More

One told the story of a 27-year-old whiz kid whose company will likely exit for $500M – $1B – the business now being less than two years old. You can imagine the effect that this had on the brilliant, hardworking 35+ entrepreneurs in the group, who have had their share of hits, but not at that magnitude and not that quickly.

But how?
I only know of four viable methods:

A simple core built-in feature, where by using the product, users invite / share it with others. This used to be mostly about email address import, although these days Digging, Tweeting, and of course, spreading on Facebook are very popular
Users embed the product onto their own blogs / pages / sites
Users create original content that gets picked up by GoogleBot, gets SEO’ed, and then brings in other users via Google search. More
